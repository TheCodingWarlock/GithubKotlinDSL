# Github Kotlin DSL
This repository showcases examples of how you can create a DSL using Kotlin Language Features.

# Description
There are 4 branches in this repository which use specific Kotlin features to build the DSL.
The different forms of DSLs used are in the branches which you can checkout (pun intended ðŸ˜Ž) using the following command:
```
git checkout -b <branch_name> <remote_branch_name>
```

This will switch to the new branch and set the branch to track the remote branch specified.
For example, to switch to the **scope-control** branch, this is the command that can be used:
```
git checkout -b scope-control-local origin/scope-control
```
